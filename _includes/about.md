I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>. I'm passionate about conducting research in <b>Artificial General Intelligence</b> and <b>Cognitive Sciences</b>. I dream of reverse engineering the human intelligence to create more general and intelligent Artificial Intelligence. To achieve this I try to probe it from both ways i.e. developing better computational models of human cognition as well as relating the individual functionality of artificial computational models with that of humans.

I have worked on several research projects related to <b>deep learning, computer vision, cognitive sciences and robotics</b>. And have had the good fortune to work with <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston) as a research intern where I was working on to bring the biological constraint of the human visual system into the state of the art deep convolutional neural network models. I’m also contributing to the <a href="http://www.brain-score.org/#about">Brain-Score</a> project organised by the <a href="http://dicarlolab.mit.edu/">DiCarlo lab @ MIT</a> in which I’m trying to implement a new benchmark based on a visual search task. Previously, I have worked under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/">Prof Nisheet Srivastava</a> (IIT Kanpur) to introduce Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity in Multi-Layer Perceptron. I also worked on a robotics and computer vision project at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Research/Research-Centres/ST-Engineering-SUTD-Centre-for-Smart-Systems">Centre for Smart System</a>, SUTD Singapore as a research intern, wherein I built a system that can be used to determine UAV positions in deep tunnels.

Apart from academics, I love to do <b>pencil sketching</b>, <b>kirigami</b>, wasting my time watching <b>animes</b> and spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i>
