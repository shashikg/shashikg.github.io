I am currently serving as a <b>Lead NLP Researcher</b> at Triomics, where I focus on harnessing LLMs and Generative AI to extract insights from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of cancer patients, with the goal of enhancing oncology research and care. Before joining Triomics, I held the position of <b>Data Scientist (MLE-3)</b> at RingCentral Innovation (India), where I specialized primarily in addressing Speech and NLP-related challenges for Conversational AI.

Before joining industry, I completed my bachelor + master degree from IIT Kanpur, where I was advised by
<a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/" target="\_blank">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA) and
<a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/" target="\_blank">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur, India).
For my master thesis (<a href="{{ site.url }}/files/thesis.pdf" target="\_blank">An Integrated Computational Model of Visual Search Combining Eccentricity, Bottom-up, and Top-down Cues</a>), I worked on the intersection of <b>computer vision</b>, <b>deep learning</b>, <b>cognitive sciences</b>, and <b>neuroscience</b>. During my undergraduate years, I was awarded the prestigious <b>Khoran Scholarship</b> by <a href="https://iusstf.org/khorana-program-for-scholars" target="\_blank">IUSSTF, WINStep and DBT (India)</a> to work with Dr. Gabriel Kreiman at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA on <b>computational neuroscience</b> and <b>deep learning</b>. Before that, I also touched upon <b>robotics</b> during my internship at the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Research/Research-Centres/ST-Engineering-SUTD-Centre-for-Smart-Systems" target="\_blank">Centre for Smart System</a>, SUTD Singapore and as a part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HumanoidIITK/" target="\_blank">Humanoid IITK Team</a>. During my academic career, I have had the good fortune to work with some incredible researchers, <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and CBMM, MIT), <a href="https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1">Mengmi Zhang</a> (NTU Singapore, and A \*STAR Singapore), <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur India), and <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/">Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava</a> (IIT Kanpur India). 
<br><br>
During my free time, I love to do <b>gardening</b>, <b>pencil sketching</b>, <b>kirigami</b>, and watching <b>animes</b>. I also love ðŸ˜´ (more than 50% of time).


<!-- The title of my thesis was <b>"An Integrated Computational Model of Visual
Search Combining Eccentricity, Bottom-up, and Top-down Cues"</b>, which was at the intersection of cognitive sciences and deep learning.focused on explaining human visual search via deep neural network based computational models.

<!-- I'm a dual-degree (BT-MT) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> supervised by <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA) and <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur, India). I am primarily interested in <b>artificial intelligence</b>, <b>cognitive neuroscience</b>, and <b>cognitive psychology</b>. And, I dream of reverse-engineering human intelligence to create more general and intelligent Artificial Intelligence and better understand human cognition. To achieve this, I follow the following three principles: 1. To understand the biological and psychological basis of human cognition, 2. To study the computational model of human cognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and 3. Finally, work on bridging the gap between humans and machines. I believe this will help us form a computational model that is better than the existing one and can also help us understand the theories of human cognition that we cannot deduce directly by studying the brain. In the pursuit of fulfilling my dream, I have had the good fortune to work with <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and CBMM, MIT), <a href="https://a0091624.wixsite.com/mengmi">Mengmi Zhang</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and CBMM, MIT), <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur), and <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/">Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava</a> (IIT Kanpur). I also worked shortly on a robotics and computer vision project at the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Research/Research-Centres/ST-Engineering-SUTD-Centre-for-Smart-Systems">Centre for Smart System</a>, SUTD Singapore. Please refer to the project section to know about the work I have done while exploring different directions.
<br><br>
I also established the <a href="https://bcs-iitk.github.io/">Brain and Cognitive Society</a> at IIT Kanpur to build a student community that works for similar objectives. Within just one year of establishment, our society emerged as one of the most active student communities and completed various neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning projects.
<br><br>
Apart from academics, I love to do <b>pencil sketching</b>, <b>kirigami</b>, wasting my time watching <b>animes</b> and spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> -->
