I'm a dual-degree (BT-MT) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> supervised by <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA) and <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur, India). I am primarily interested in <b>artificial intelligence</b>, <b>cognitive neuroscience</b>, and <b>cognitive psychology</b>. And, I dream of reverse-engineering human intelligence to create more general and intelligent Artificial Intelligence and better understand human cognition. To achieve this, I follow the following three principles: 1. To understand the biological and psychological basis of human cognition, 2. To study the computational model of human cognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and 3. Finally, work on bridging the gap between humans and machines. I believe this will help us form a computational model that is better than the existing one and can also help us understand the theories of human cognition that we cannot deduce directly by studying the brain. In the pursuit of fulfilling my dream, I have had the good fortune to work with <a href="http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/">Dr. Gabriel Kreiman</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and CBMM, MIT), <a href="https://a0091624.wixsite.com/mengmi">Mengmi Zhang</a> (Harvard Medical School, Boston, and CBMM, MIT), <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</a> (IIT Kanpur), and <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/">Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava</a> (IIT Kanpur). I also worked shortly on a robotics and computer vision project at the <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Research/Research-Centres/ST-Engineering-SUTD-Centre-for-Smart-Systems">Centre for Smart System</a>, SUTD Singapore. Please refer to the project section to know about the work I have done while exploring different directions.

I also established the <a href="https://bcs-iitk.github.io/">Brain and Cognitive Society</a> at IIT Kanpur to build a student community that works for similar objectives. Within just one year of establishment, our society emerged as one of the most active student communities and completed various neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning projects.

Apart from academics, I love to do <b>pencil sketching</b>, <b>kirigami</b>, wasting my time watching <b>animes</b> and spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i>
