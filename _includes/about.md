I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>. I'm motivated toward <b>Cognitive Sciences</b> (Computational, Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology). I also find myself interested toward <b>Signal Processing</b> and <b>Computer Vision</b>. I dream of building an artificial agent which can mimic <b>humans!!</b>

Apart from academic, I love to do <b>pencil sketching</b>, <b>kirigami</b>, wasting my time watching <b>animes</b> and spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i>
