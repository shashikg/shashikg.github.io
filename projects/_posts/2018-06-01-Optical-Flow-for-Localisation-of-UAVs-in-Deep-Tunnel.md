title: Optical Flow for Localisation of UAVs in Deep Tunnel
abstract: Worked on the Optical Flow algorithm based on SAD block matching to determine UAV position in deep tunnels i.e. GPS denied environment.

- Worked on the Optical Flow algorithm based on SAD block matching to determine UAV position in
deep tunnels i.e. GPS denied environment (coded in python, for actual prototype PX4FLOW was used )
- Developed a self-prediction based algorithm to correct the errors in inconsistent flow calculation
- Performed various experiments to collect data samples to measure and analyse performance
- Worked on implementing Extended Kalman Filter to use acceleration data to improve accuracy
- Demo Paper accepted at IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference, Las Vegas, USA
