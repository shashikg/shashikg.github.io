- Extracts human faces (using OpenCV haar-cascade/ dnn based classifier) from a camera stream and
classifies them into 7 different moods i.e. Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and Neutral
- CNN classifier (with ensemble) was designed, which was trained on the ICML 2013 dataset of Facial
Expression Recognition Challenge on kaggle to achieve an accuracy of ~65.34% on the private test data
