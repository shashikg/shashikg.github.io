Wireless sensor networks attract novel applications in diverse fields of life and sci- ence every day. Numerous open challenges related to energy consumption, accurate synchronization and communication often overshadows the main reason for the WSN systems development, i.e., accurate estimation of parameters used in decision mak- ing process.Parametric estimation is one of crucial problems. Better strategies for parametric estimation in sensor networks with achievable bounds.
- Implementation of a research paper, which proposes a general framework to achieve CRLB bounds
- Successfuly implemented the proposed method in MATLAB to produce the results
