title: Cooperative Localization Using Posterior Linearization Belief Propagation
abstract: Implementation of a research paper, which presents the Posterior Linearization Belief Propagation algorithm for cooperative localization in Sensor Networks
---
- Implementation of a research paper, which presents the PLBP algorithm for cooperative localization
- Learned about and implemented Statistical Linear Regression using unscented transform on a
chosen sets of sigma points to linearise the proposed non-linear model.
- Implemented the Belief Propagation algorithm to infer the marginals for different sensor nodes.
