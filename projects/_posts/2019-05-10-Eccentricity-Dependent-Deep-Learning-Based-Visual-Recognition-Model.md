I was working on to bring the biological constraint of the human visual system into the state of the art deep convolutional neural network models. As we know our (human) visual system is characterized by eccentricity dependent sampling (i.e. we have higher resolution in the fovea region which happens to decrease when we move towards the periphery). I was implementing this type of sampling the computational model and performed some experimental verification to match the result with that of the human visual system.
